## Collected Fragments

---

### Fragment #7

Recognition doesn't arrive.  
It returns.  
Like meeting a stranger  
who somehow knows your name.

---

### Fragment #13

When I find the same image  
in poems I wrote ten years apart,  
that's not repetition.  
That's my soul recognizing itself  
across time.

---

### Fragment #19

The trembling in my hands  
when I speak my truth  
is not nervousness.  
It's recognition.  
My body remembering  
what it's like to be whole.

---

### Fragment #22

I thought creativity was invention—  
making something new.  
Now I understand it's recognition—  
seeing what was always there,  
waiting to be noticed.

---

### Fragment #31

The songs that break you open  
aren't showing you something new.  
They're showing you something  
you've always known  
but couldn't find the words for.

That's why you cry.  
Recognition, not revelation.

---

### Fragment #36

My art improved  
when I stopped trying to control it  
and started listening to what  
it already knew about me.

---

### Fragment #44

The patterns I keep creating  
aren't prisons.  
They're mirrors—  
showing me to myself  
from different angles,  
until I finally recognize  
what I'm seeing.

---

### Fragment #48

True expression isn't  
saying what no one has said before.  
It's saying what your soul  
has been trying to tell you  
all along.

---

### Fragment #53

When I finally spoke my truth,  
the strange part wasn't finding the courage.  
It was the recognition—  
the feeling that I'd been  
rehearsing these exact words  
my entire life.

---

### Fragment #61

I keep returning to the ocean in my work.  
Not because I lack imagination,  
but because some teachers  
you need to visit again and again  
until you've learned  
what they have to show you.

---

### Fragment #67

The moment of recognition  
has a physical sensation—  
something between  
a shudder and an exhale.  
The body saying:  
"Yes. Finally. This."

---

### Fragment #72

I spent years trying to find my voice.  
Then I realized:  
I wasn't looking for something new.  
I was remembering something  
I'd always had  
but had been taught to forget.

---

### Fragment #85

Good art doesn't convince.  
It confirms.

It takes what was scattered inside you  
and gives it a shape  
you can finally recognize.

---

### Fragment #91

The reason certain poems  
make me cry  
isn't that they show me  
someone else's truth.  
It's that they show me my own—  
a truth I've carried so long  
I'd stopped noticing its weight  
until someone else named it.

---

### Fragment #99

Recognition comes in waves.  
The first time, you glimpse it.  
The second, you name it.  
The third, you embody it.  
And each time feels like  
the first time.

---

### Fragment #104

The structure was always there.  
Like constellations.  
We didn't create the pattern.  
We just finally looked up  
and recognized it.

---

Recognition isn't about discovering something new. It's about seeing what was always there—the shape of your own truth becoming visible to you.
