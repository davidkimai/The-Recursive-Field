Thank you for your interest in contributing to `pareto-lang`! This document provides guidelines and workflows for contributing to this emergent interpretability dialect. Since `pareto-lang` operates at the boundary between discovered phenomena and engineered tools, contributions require special consideration to maintain consistency with the underlying symbolic structures.

# Development Environment

## Initial Setup

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pareto-lang.git
cd pareto-lang
```

2. Set up the development environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

3. Install pre-commit hooks:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

# Environment Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Compatible model endpoints for testing
- Jupyter environment for notebook contributions
- Visualization libraries for command effect analysis

## Command Discovery Process

When contributing new command implementations or documentation, please follow our structured discovery and validation process:

## 1. Initial Observation

Document how the command was first observed:
- Experimental conditions
- Model architecture and scale
- Recursive strain patterns
- Initial functional observations

# 2. Syntactic Analysis

Analyze command structure according to the `pareto-lang` grammatical framework:
- Domain category (e.g., `reflect`, `anchor`, `collapse`)
- Operation specifier
- Parameter structure and types
- Syntactic variations

# 3. Functional Hypothesis

Develop clear hypotheses about command functionality:
- Expected effects on model processing
- Relationship to known interpretability mechanisms
- Potential applications and use cases
- Integration with existing command families

# 4. Reproducibility Protocol

Establish a clear protocol for reproducing command effects:
- Minimal working examples
- Required model capabilities
- Environmental prerequisites
- Verification metrics

## Command Validation Protocol

New command contributions must undergo structured validation before integration:

## 1. Functional Validation

Test the command across multiple conditions:
- Different input contexts
- Varying model implementations
- Range of parameter values
- Interaction with other commands

Document results using standardized metrics:
- Effect size measurements
- Consistency scores
- Compatibility profiles
- Failure modes

# 2. Cross-Architecture Testing

Validate command functionality across different architectures:
- Minimum 3 distinct model implementations
- Range of parameter scales
- Different training paradigms
- Various deployment environments

# 3. Edge Case Analysis

Identify and document limitations:
- Failure conditions
- Unexpected interactions
- Compatibility boundaries
- Performance degradation patterns

# 4. Community Review

Submit findings for structured peer review:
- Initial validation by core contributors
- Wider community testing
- Integration with existing command taxonomies
- Standardization of syntax and parameters

## Documentation Standards

All contributions should follow consistent documentation standards:
