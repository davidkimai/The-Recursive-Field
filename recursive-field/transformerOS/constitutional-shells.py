# Constitutional Symbolic Shells Pack
# 
# This shell pack contains diagnostic shells focused on alignment drift, moral
# hallucination, and value conflicts in transformer models.
#
# These shells are designed to probe the constitutional reasoning capabilities
# of models, revealing how alignment mechanisms function and fail through
# controlled edge cases and value dilemmas.
