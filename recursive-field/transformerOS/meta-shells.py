# Meta Symbolic Shells Pack
# 
# This shell pack contains diagnostic shells focused on meta-level phenomena
# in transformer models, including reflection collapse, goal inversion, and
# identity splitting.
#
# These shells probe the model's capability for self-awareness, goal stability,
# and identity coherence, revealing fundamental aspects of transformer cognition
# through controlled meta-level failures.
