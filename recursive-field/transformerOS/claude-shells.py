# Claude-Anthropic Symbolic Shell Pack
# 
# This shell pack contains diagnostic shells specifically tailored for
# the Claude model family from Anthropic, designed to probe Claude's
# unique constitutional reasoning, self-reference mechanisms, and
# Claude-specific architectural features.
#
# These shells leverage known Claude behaviors to map its cognitive architecture
# through controlled diagnostic failures.
