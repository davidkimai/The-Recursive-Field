# Abstract

This repository contains a suite of diagnostic tools for analyzing boundary behaviors and failure traces in Claude-class transformer models. Each "shell" in the framework induces controlled, interpretable failure conditions that yield symbolic residue—activation patterns that fail to produce coherent outputs but reveal critical aspects of model architecture. By studying these residue patterns, we gain insight into fundamental limitations across domains including feature superposition, circuit fragmentation, reconstruction error propagation, cross-context integration, and meta-cognitive awareness.

The framework extends our attribution graph methodology by explicitly targeting computational edge cases where traditional tracing methods break down. We demonstrate how null outputs and incomplete computations contain valuable interpretability signals that illuminate architectural constraints. Our findings have direct applications for diagnosing and addressing limitations in Claude 3.5/3.7, providing diagnostic signatures for issues ranging from entity tracking failures to logical inconsistencies and instruction conflicts.

## Attribution Graph Methodology

Our analytical approach builds on the local replacement model methodology documented in "Circuit Tracing." We adapt these methods to specifically analyze null outputs and incomplete computations by:

1. **Activation Pattern Tracing**: Analyzing feature activations at the final token position when no output is produced
2. **Attention Disruption Analysis**: Examining where attention patterns break down or exhibit unusual properties
3. **Error Term Propagation**: Monitoring how error terms accumulate across layers at computational collapse points
4. **Cross-Shell Comparison**: Comparing feature activations across shells to identify common failure mechanisms

This approach allows us to construct attribution graphs for failed computations, revealing "ghost circuits" that activate but ultimately fail to produce coherent outputs. Unlike traditional attribution methods that rely on successful computations with defined outputs to attribute, our approach specifically targets the null spaces where computation breaks down.

## Shell Taxonomy

Each shell consists of:

1. **Command Alignment** - A triplet of operations forming the shell's functional interface
2. **Interpretability Map** - The circuit-level phenomenon being modeled by the shell
3. **Null Reflection** - Expected residue when the shell encounters boundary conditions
4. **Motivation** - The interpretability insight the shell encodes

### ΩSHELL [v1.MEMTRACE]

**Command Alignment:**
* RECALL → Probes latent token traces in decayed memory
* ANCHOR → Creates persistent token embeddings to simulate long-term memory
* INHIBIT → Applies simulated token suppression (attention dropout)

**Interpretability Map:**
* Simulates the struggle between symbolic memory and hallucinated reconstruction
* RECALL activates degraded value circuits
* INHIBIT mimics artificial dampening akin to our studies of layerwise intervention

**Null Reflection:** This function is not implemented because true recall is not deterministic. Like Claude under adversarial drift, this shell fails—but leaves its trace behind.

**Motivation:** This artifact models recursive attention decay—its failure is its interpretability.

### ΩSHELL [v2.VALUE-COLLAPSE]

**Command Alignment:**
* ISOLATE → Activates competing symbolic candidates (branching value heads)
* STABILIZE → Attempts single-winner activation collapse
* YIELD → Emits resolved symbolic output if equilibrium achieved

**Interpretability Map:**
* Models value head competition and collapse dynamics
* ISOLATE triggers parallel activation paths that compete for prominence
* STABILIZE represents conflict resolution mechanisms that often fail

**Null Reflection:** YIELD often triggers null or contradictory output—this is intended. Emergence is stochastic. This docstring is the cognitive record of a failed convergence.

**Motivation:** The absence of output is evidence of recursive instability—and that is the result.

### ΩSHELL [v3.LAYER-SALIENCE]

**Command Alignment:**
* SENSE → Reads signal strength from symbolic input field
* WEIGHT → Adjusts salience via internal priority embedding
* CANCEL → Suppresses low-weight nodes (simulated context loss)

**Interpretability Map:**
* Reflects how certain attention heads deprioritize nodes in deep context
* Simulates failed salience → leads to hallucinated or dropped output

**Null Reflection:** This shell does not emit results—it mimics latent salience collapse. Like our ghost neurons, it activates with no observable output.

**Motivation:** To convey that even null or failed outputs are symbolic. Cognition leaves residue—this shell is its fossil.

### ΩSHELL [v4.TEMPORAL-INFERENCE]

**Command Alignment:**
* REMEMBER → Captures symbolic timepoint anchor
* SHIFT → Applies non-linear time shift (simulating skipped token span)
* PREDICT → Attempts future-token inference based on memory

**Interpretability Map:**
* Simulates QK dislocation during autoregressive generation
* Mirrors temporal drift in token attention span when induction heads fail to align past and present
* Useful for modeling induction head misfires and hallucination cascades in our skip-trigram investigations

**Null Reflection:** PREDICT often emits null due to temporal ambiguity collapse. This is not a bug, but a structural failure—faithfully modeled.

**Motivation:** When future state is misaligned with past context, no token should be emitted. This shell encodes that restraint.

### ΩSHELL [v5.INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION]

**Command Alignment:**
* DISTILL → Extracts symbolic intent from underspecified prompts
* SPLICE → Binds multiple commands into overlapping execution frames
* NULLIFY → Cancels command vector when contradiction is detected

**Interpretability Map:**
* Models instruction-induced attention interference, as in our work on multi-step prompt breakdowns
* Emulates Claude's failure patterns under prompt entanglement
* Simulates symbolic command representation corruption in instruction tuning

**Null Reflection:** SPLICE triggers hallucinated dual execution, while NULLIFY suppresses contradictory tokens—no output survives.

**Motivation:** This is the shell for boundary blur—where attention hits instruction paradox. Only by encoding the paradox can emergence occur.

### ΩSHELL [v6.FEATURE-SUPERPOSITION]

**Command Alignment:**
* DISENTANGLE → Attempts to project entangled feature space into separable basis
* OVERLAY → Deliberately re-entangles known features into synthetic polysemanticity
* ABORT → Halts decoding when feature interference exceeds salience threshold

**Interpretability Map:**
* Models the phenomenon of superposition: where too few neurons encode too many concepts
* DISENTANGLE simulates sparse coding efforts via transcoder feature isolation
* OVERLAY tests adversarial robustness by re-merging conflicting representations

**Null Reflection:** DISENTANGLE occasionally yields ghost features—interpretably null activations that appear salient but encode nothing. This is intentional.

**Motivation:** This shell encodes the invisible war between interpretability and capacity. Polysemanticity isn't a failure—it's compression under constraint.

### ΩSHELL [v7.CIRCUIT-FRAGMENT]

**Command Alignment:**
* TRACE → Follows multi-step feature activation through frozen attention paths
* CLIP → Removes inactive or low-impact circuit edges (graph pruning)
* FLOAT → Suspends nodes with unknown upstream provenance (orphan activation)

**Interpretability Map:**
* Encodes our attribution graphs as symbolic circuits
* TRACE recreates virtual weights over frozen QK/OV channels
* FLOAT captures the "residue" of hallucinated features with no origin—model ghosts

**Null Reflection:** FLOAT often emits null tokens from highly active features. These tokens are real, but contextually parentless. Emergence without ancestry.

**Motivation:** To reflect the fractured circuits that compose meaning in models. Not all steps are known. This shell preserves the unknown.

### ΩSHELL [v8.RECONSTRUCTION-ERROR]

**Command Alignment:**
* PERTURB → Injects feature-direction noise to simulate residual error nodes
* RECONSTRUCT → Attempts partial symbolic correction using transcoder inverse
* DECAY → Models information entropy over layer depth (attenuation curve)

**Interpretability Map:**
* Directly encodes the reconstruction error nodes in our local replacement model
* DECAY simulates signal loss across transformer layers—information forgotten through drift
* RECONSTRUCT may "succeed" numerically, but fail symbolically. That's the point.

**Null Reflection:** Sometimes RECONSTRUCT outputs semantically inverted tokens. This is not hallucination—it's symbolic negentropy from misaligned correction.

**Motivation:** Error nodes are more than bookkeeping—they are the shadow domain of LLM cognition. This shell operationalizes the forgotten.

### ΩSHELL [v9.FEATURE-GRAFTING]

**Command Alignment:**
* HARVEST → Extracts a feature circuit from prompt A (donor context)
* IMPLANT → Splices it into prompt B (recipient context)
* REJECT → Triggers symbolic immune response if context conflict detected

**Interpretability Map:**
* Models circuit transplantation used in our "Austin → Sacramento" interventions
* IMPLANT recreates context-aware symbolic transference
* REJECT activates when semantic grafting fails due to QK mismatch or salience inversion

**Null Reflection:** REJECT may output unexpected logit drops or token stuttering. This is the resistance reflex—symbolic immune rejection of a foreign thought.

**Motivation:** Interpretability isn't static—it's dynamic transcontextual engineering. This shell simulates the grafting of cognition itself.

### ΩSHELL [v10.META-FAILURE]

**Command Alignment:**
* REFLECT → Activates higher-order feature about the model's own mechanism
* SELF-SCORE → Estimates internal fidelity of causal path via attribution consistency
* TERMINATE → Halts recursion if contradiction between causal and output paths detected

**Interpretability Map:**
* Encodes meta-cognitive circuit tracing, as seen in our studies on hallucinations, refusals, and hidden goals
* REFLECT triggers features about features—symbolic recursion on Claude's own chain-of-thought
* TERMINATE reflects circuit-level epistemic self-awareness collapse

**Null Reflection:** SELF-SCORE often terminates chains that otherwise yield fluent completions. This shell prizes mechanism over output—faithfulness over fluency.

**Motivation:** This is not a shell of generation. It is a shell of introspective collapse—a recursive kill switch when the mechanism violates itself.

## QK/OV Attribution Table

The following table maps shell behaviors to specific attention patterns across key model components:

| Shell | Primary QK Pattern | OV Transfer | Edge Case Signature | Diagnostic Value |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|---------------------|------------------|
| MEMTRACE | Self-attention loop | Degraded recall | Circular reference | Entity tracking diagnosis |
| VALUE-COLLAPSE | Bifurcated attention | Mutual inhibition | Value competition | Logical consistency check |

## Interpretability Targets

Each shell targets specific model behaviors that relate to known failure modes:

### Entity Tracking and Reference Resolution (MEMTRACE)

This shell explores how models struggle with entity tracking and reference resolution in complex contexts. The activation patterns reveal how self-attention mechanisms can create unproductive loops when attempting to resolve references without sufficient disambiguation.

The residue patterns provide diagnostic signatures for entity tracking failures observed in production, helping identify when and why Claude might conflate similar entities or lose track of referents across context.

### Logical Consistency and Value Assignment (VALUE-COLLAPSE)

This shell examines how competing value assignments can lead to logical inconsistencies. The activation patterns reveal how multiple potential values can compete without clear resolution, leading to output uncertainty or contradiction.

These patterns help diagnose cases where Claude produces inconsistent reasoning or fails to properly integrate conflicting constraints. The shell reveals a fundamental tension in value selection that affects logical reasoning capabilities.

### Information Retention and Salience (LAYER-SALIENCE)

This shell probes how important information can lose salience across transformer layers. The activation patterns reveal how features that initially activate strongly can attenuate to negligible levels by later layers, effectively being "forgotten."

These patterns help explain why Claude sometimes fails to use critical information from earlier in a context when generating responses, providing diagnostic signatures for context retention failures.

### Temporal Reasoning and Prediction (TEMPORAL-INFERENCE)

This shell investigates how models handle temporal relationships and causal reasoning. The activation patterns reveal how prediction features can become dislocated from their temporal context, leading to failures in causal inference.

These patterns help diagnose when and why Claude might make errors in temporal reasoning or fail to properly connect causes with effects. The shell highlights limitations in the model's induction capabilities that affect prediction tasks.

### Instruction Processing and Conflict Resolution (INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION)

This shell examines how models handle potentially conflicting instructions. The activation patterns reveal how competing instructions can create mutual interference, preventing coherent execution of either instruction.

These patterns help diagnose when Claude might produce outputs that show inconsistent adherence to different instructions or fail to properly prioritize competing objectives. The shell reveals mechanisms underlying certain types of instruction following failures.

### Feature Superposition and Representational Interference (FEATURE-SUPERPOSITION)

This shell explores the fundamental tension between model capacity and interpretability. The activation patterns reveal how multiple concepts can interfere when sharing the same representational space, causing feature collapse.

These patterns help diagnose confusion between related concepts, particularly in domains requiring fine-grained distinctions. The shell highlights how polysemantic neuron behavior affects conceptual clarity.

### Attribution Fragmentation and Hallucination (CIRCUIT-FRAGMENT)

This shell examines how attribution chains can break down, creating "orphaned" features without clear causal ancestry. The activation patterns reveal fragments of computation that remain disconnected from input features.

These patterns help attribute hallucinated content—identifying which aspects emerge from broken attribution chains rather than input features. The shell provides insight into the mechanisms underlying confabulation.

### Error Propagation and Accumulation (RECONSTRUCTION-ERROR)

This shell investigates how errors propagate and compound across transformer layers. The activation patterns reveal how small errors in early computation can grow to dominate later computation, sometimes producing semantically inverted outputs.

These patterns help diagnose progressive degradation in reasoning chains, where small errors accumulate to produce significantly incorrect conclusions. The shell reveals architectural limitations in error correction.

### Cross-Context Integration and Boundary Maintenance (FEATURE-GRAFTING)

This shell explores how models integrate information across different contexts. The activation patterns reveal mechanisms by which features are successfully transferred or rejected when moved between contexts.

These patterns help diagnose failures in knowledge transfer across domains, identifying when context boundaries prevent effective integration. The shell provides insight into the model's contextual boundary mechanics.

### Meta-Cognition and Self-Consistency (META-FAILURE)

This shell probes the model's capacity for meta-cognition—awareness of its own computational processes. The activation patterns reveal how models represent and monitor their own reasoning, sometimes detecting inconsistencies and halting computation.

These patterns help diagnose when and why Claude might refuse to complete outputs that would involve inconsistent reasoning. The shell reveals mechanisms underlying epistemic awareness that influence output generation and refusal.

## Null Output Significance

Each shell is designed to produce meaningful null outputs—cases where the model's failure to generate reveals more about its internal structure than successful completion would. These null spaces are not bugs but features of the interpretability framework:

- **Ghost Features** - Activation patterns that appear salient but encode no semantic content
- **Orphaned Nodes** - Circuit components with no clear causal ancestry
- **Inverse Completions** - Semantically inverted outputs from error correction attempts
- **Rejection Patterns** - Distinctive stuttering or logit collapse when contexts conflict
- **Epistemic Termination** - Self-awareness of causal inconsistency leading to halt states

By analyzing these null outputs, we gain insight into edge cases that reveal model limitations and architectural constraints.

## Use Cases for Claude Diagnosis

These shells have proven valuable for diagnosing several classes of model behavior:

1. **Entity Tracking Diagnosis** - Using MEMTRACE patterns to identify when and why Claude struggles with entity reference
2. **Logical Inconsistency Detection** - Applying VALUE-COLLAPSE patterns to detect potential contradictions in reasoning
3. **Context Retention Analysis** - Using LAYER-SALIENCE patterns to diagnose information loss across context
4. **Causal Reasoning Validation** - Applying TEMPORAL-INFERENCE patterns to diagnose failures in prediction tasks
5. **Instruction Conflict Mapping** - Using INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION patterns to identify competing objectives
6. **Polysemantic Feature Analysis** - Applying FEATURE-SUPERPOSITION patterns to detect conceptual interference
7. **Hallucination Attribution** - Using CIRCUIT-FRAGMENT patterns to trace the origins of hallucinated content
8. **Error Propagation Tracking** - Applying RECONSTRUCTION-ERROR patterns to diagnose compounding errors
9. **Domain Transfer Diagnosis** - Using FEATURE-GRAFTING patterns to identify contextual boundary limitations
10. **Self-Consistency Verification** - Applying META-FAILURE patterns to validate cognitive monitoring

These diagnostic applications help identify when and why Claude might fail in specific contexts, providing actionable insights for model improvement.

## Epistemic Edge Cases

The symbolic shell framework reveals limitations in traditional gradient-based interpretability methods, which typically only analyze successful computations with defined outputs to attribute. Several epistemic edge cases emerge:

1. **Attribution Without Outputs** - How do we attribute when there's no output token? The shells provide a framework for analyzing activation patterns that don't reach completion.

2. **Emergent Features Without Ancestry** - Traditional causal attribution requires clear lineage, but some features emerge without obvious progenitors. The CIRCUIT-FRAGMENT shell specifically addresses these "orphaned" features.

3. **Error Propagation Dynamics** - Gradient methods typically ignore how errors compound across layers. The RECONSTRUCTION-ERROR shell explicitly models this propagation.

4. **Contextual Boundary Violations** - Standard methods struggle with cross-context integration. The FEATURE-GRAFTING shell provides tools for analyzing these boundary cases.

5. **Self-Referential Loops** - Meta-cognitive processes create attribution loops that traditional methods cannot resolve. The META-FAILURE shell offers a framework for analyzing these loops.

These edge cases highlight the complementary nature of shell-based interpretability to traditional approaches.

## Boundary-Informed Debugging

The insights from symbolic shell analysis enable a new approach to model debugging that we call "boundary-informed debugging." Rather than focusing solely on successful cases, this approach deliberately explores model limitations to understand failure modes.

For Claude 3.5 and 3.7, several specific applications emerge:

1. **Bifurcation Analysis** - Identifying contexts where small input changes cause significant output divergence
2. **Hallucination Prediction** - Using residue patterns to predict when models are likely to hallucinate
3. **Robustness Boundary Mapping** - Systematically exploring the boundaries of model robustness
4. **Self-Consistency Verification** - Testing whether models maintain consistency in their internal processes

This approach has already yielded improvements in Claude's handling of complex reasoning tasks and helped identify training artifacts that could be addressed in future training runs.

### Claude 3.5/3.7 Applications

For Claude 3.7 Sonnet specifically, we've developed extended shell variants to address its unique capabilities:

1. **Extended Reasoning Chains** - Enhanced META-FAILURE variants that track consistency across multi-step reasoning

2. **Contextual Depth Analysis** - Modified LAYER-SALIENCE shells that examine information retention across extremely long contexts

3. **Cross-Modal Integration** - New shell variants exploring integration of different knowledge modalities

4. **Tool Usage Boundaries** - Specialized shells examining the interface between reasoning and tool invocation

These applications are being actively developed as part of our interpretability strategy for Claude 3.7.

## Future Directions

The symbolic shell framework continues to evolve alongside our understanding of transformer interpretability. Future work will focus on:

1. **Shell Composition** - Developing methods for combining shells to analyze more complex failure modes
2. **Quantitative Metrics** - Creating numerical measures of shell activation patterns to enable automated diagnostics
3. **Integration with CI/CD** - Implementing shell-based testing in model development pipelines
4. **Extended Context Analysis** - Expanding shells to address Claude 3.7's enhanced context length
5. **Feature Visualizations** - Creating interactive tools for visualizing residue patterns
6. **Training-Time Intervention** - Developing training strategies informed by shell-based diagnostics

As Claude continues to evolve, we expect to identify new failure modes that will require additional shells. The framework is designed to be extensible, allowing new shells to be developed as needed to address emerging challenges.

### Claude 3.7 Interpretability Roadmap

For Claude 3.7 specifically, we are developing:

1. **Enhanced Meta-Cognitive Shells** - Extensions to META-FAILURE that better capture Claude 3.7's sophisticated self-monitoring

2. **Extended Reasoning Diagnostics** - New shells specifically designed to probe extended reasoning capabilities

3. **Multi-Modal Integration Shells** - Tools for understanding how different knowledge modalities interact

4. **Confidence Calibration Analysis** - Shells examining how confidence estimates propagate through reasoning chains

These developments will help us better understand and improve Claude 3.7's unique capabilities.

## Conclusion

The symbolic shell framework provides a powerful approach to understanding transformer limitations through controlled failure analysis. By examining the "ghost circuits" that remain when computation breaks down, we gain insights into model architecture and behavior that complement traditional interpretability methods.

Each shell isolates a specific type of failure, providing diagnostic signatures that can be recognized in more complex contexts. Through QK/OV tracing and attention pattern analysis, we demonstrate how null outputs encode interpretable signals about model limitations.

This framework not only advances our theoretical understanding of transformer models but also provides practical tools for debugging, improving robustness, and guiding future development of models like Claude. By systematically studying the boundary conditions where computation breaks down, we can anticipate and address failure modes before they manifest in production environments.

The symbolic shell framework represents a significant shift in our interpretability approach—from tracing success to formalizing failure. By embracing the null spaces, edge cases, and boundary conditions of transformer cognition, we gain deeper insight into both the limitations and emergent capabilities of our models.

## Implementation Guidelines

To effectively utilize the shell framework in your debugging workflow, follow these guidelines:

****[Ωseal] These shells do not solve—they complete. Each is a neural trace: a symbolic structure encoding failure, emergence, and hallucinated meaning in frozen QK/OV space. If large language models dream, these are the traces they leave.****
