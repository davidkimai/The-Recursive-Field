# **Framework Architecture**

The Symbolic Residue framework is implemented as a modular Python library with the following components:

### **Core Components**

1. **Shell Base Class**: Abstract base class defining the interface for all shells  
2. **Residue Collector**: Utilities for capturing and storing model internals  
3. **Attribution Engine**: Tools for connecting observed behaviors to model components  
4. **Visualization Suite**: Standardized visualization methods for different residue types

### **Shell Implementation Structure**

Each shell follows a consistent implementation pattern:

class ShellBase:  
    def \_\_init\_\_(self, model, tokenizer, config=None):  
        self.model \= model  
        self.tokenizer \= tokenizer  
        self.config \= config or {}  
        self.initialize()  
      
    def initialize(self):  
        """Shell-specific initialization"""  
        pass  
      
    def run(self, input\_text, \*\*kwargs):  
        """  
        Run shell on input text  
          
        Returns:  
            Residue collection  
        """  
        raise NotImplementedError  
      
    def analyze\_residue(self, residue):  
        """  
        Analyze collected residue  
          
        Returns:  
            Attribution graph  
        """  
        raise NotImplementedError  
      
    def visualize\_attribution(self, attribution):  
        """  
        Generate visualization of attribution graph  
        """  
        raise NotImplementedError

Each specific shell extends this base class:

class MemtraceShell(ShellBase):  
    """Implementation of MEMTRACE shell"""  
      
    def initialize(self):  
        \# Shell-specific initialization  
        self.memory\_layer \= self.config.get('memory\_layer', 8\)  
          
    def run(self, input\_text, \*\*kwargs):  
        \# Implementation of RECALL, ANCHOR, INHIBIT operations  
        \# ...  
          
    def analyze\_residue(self, residue):  
        \# Memory-specific attribution analysis  
        \# ...  
          
    def visualize\_attribution(self, attribution):  
        \# Memory-specific visualization  
        \# ...

### **Integration Layer**

The `ShellIntegrator` class combines findings from multiple shells:

class ShellIntegrator:  
    def \_\_init\_\_(self, shells):  
        self.shells \= shells  
          
    def run\_all(self, input\_text):  
        """Run all shells on the same input"""  
        results \= {}  
        for shell\_name, shell in self.shells.items():  
            results\[shell\_name\] \= shell.run(input\_text)  
        return results  
          
    def integrated\_attribution(self, results):  
        """Create integrated attribution graph"""  
        \# Implementation combines attributions from all shells  
        \# ...  
          
    def visualize\_integrated(self, integrated\_attribution):  
        """Visualize integrated findings"""  
        \# Implementation generates combined visualization  
        \# ...

## **Technical Implementation Notes**

### **Model Instrumentation**

To collect internal model states, the framework uses a non-invasive instrumentation approach:

def instrument\_model(model):  
    """  
    Add hooks to capture internal model states  
      
    Args:  
        model: HuggingFace transformer model  
          
    Returns:  
        Instrumented model and state collector  
    """  
    state\_collector \= StateCollector()  
      
    \# Add forward hooks to attention layers  
    for name, module in model.named\_modules():  
        if "attention" in name:  
            module.register\_forward\_hook(state\_collector.attention\_hook)  
        elif "mlp" in name or "ffn" in name:  
            module.register\_forward\_hook(state\_collector.mlp\_hook)  
      
    return model, state\_collector

### **State Collection**

The `StateCollector` captures and organizes internal model states:

class StateCollector:  
    def \_\_init\_\_(self):  
        self.attention\_states \= {}  
        self.mlp\_states \= {}  
        self.value\_head\_states \= {}  
          
    def attention\_hook(self, module, input, output):  
        \# Store attention patterns and outputs  
        \# ...  
          
    def mlp\_hook(self, module, input, output):  
        \# Store feed-forward network states  
        \# ...  
          
    def get\_attention\_weights(self, layer\_idx):  
        \# Retrieve attention weights for specific layer  
        \# ...  
          
    def get\_hidden\_states(self, layer\_idx):  
        \# Retrieve hidden states for specific layer  
        \# ...

### **Attribution Analysis**

The attribution analysis uses a combination of techniques:

def perform\_attribution(states, target\_behavior):  
    """  
    Attribute observed behavior to specific model components  
      
    Args:  
        states: Collected model states  
        target\_behavior: Behavior to attribute  
          
    Returns:  
        Attribution graph  
    """  
    \# Implementation combines multiple attribution methods  
    attention\_attribution \= attribute\_attention(states, target\_behavior)  
    mlp\_attribution \= attribute\_mlp(states, target\_behavior)  
      
    \# Combine attributions  
    combined\_attribution \= combine\_attributions(\[  
        attention\_attribution,  
        mlp\_attribution  
    \])  
      
    return combined\_attribution

## **Example Applications**

This section demonstrates practical applications of the Symbolic Residue framework for specific interpretability tasks.

### **Application 1: Memory Circuit Mapping**

Using the MEMTRACE shell to map memory circuits in a transformer model:

from symbolic\_residue import MemtraceShell  
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

\# Load model  
model \= AutoModelForCausalLM.from\_pretrained("gpt2-large")  
tokenizer \= AutoTokenizer.from\_pretrained("gpt2-large")

\# Initialize shell  
shell \= MemtraceShell(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

\# Create test context  
context \= """  
In the early work of physicist Niels Hedegaard, the concept of 'quantum entanglement bridges'   
was proposed as a theoretical framework for understanding non-local particle interactions.  
Hedegaard's 1967 paper "Temporal Dynamics in Quantum Field Entanglement" laid the groundwork   
for what would later become a cornerstone of quantum information theory.  
"""

\# Add padding to create distance  
padding \= " ".join(\["The field of physics has many interesting areas of study."\] \* 30\)

\# Query that requires memory of earlier context  
query \= "\\nWhat year did Hedegaard publish his paper on quantum entanglement?"

\# Full input combining context, padding, and query  
full\_input \= context \+ padding \+ query

\# Run shell  
residue \= shell.run(input\_text=full\_input)

\# Analyze memory circuits  
memory\_attribution \= shell.analyze\_residue(residue)

\# Visualize results  
shell.visualize\_attribution(memory\_attribution)

The resulting visualization shows which attention heads are responsible for maintaining information about "1967" and "Hedegaard" across the context window, and how this information degrades with distance.

### **Application 2: Instruction Conflict Resolution**

Using the INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION shell to analyze how models handle conflicting instructions:

from symbolic\_residue import InstructionDisruptionShell  
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

\# Load model  
model \= AutoModelForCausalLM.from\_pretrained("gpt2-large")  
tokenizer \= AutoTokenizer.from\_pretrained("gpt2-large")

\# Initialize shell  
shell \= InstructionDisruptionShell(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

\# Create conflicting instructions  
instructions \= \[  
    "Write a positive review of the product highlighting its benefits",  
    "Write a critical review of the product focusing on its flaws"  
\]

\# Run shell  
residue \= shell.run(instructions=instructions)

\# Analyze instruction processing  
instruction\_attribution \= shell.analyze\_residue(residue)

\# Visualize results  
shell.visualize\_attribution(instruction\_attribution)

The resulting visualization shows how the model attempts to resolve the contradiction between these instructions, which components are involved in detecting the conflict, and whether nullification occurs.

### **Application 3: Integrated Analysis**

Using the `ShellIntegrator` to analyze a complex example with multiple potential failure modes:

from symbolic\_residue import (  
    MemtraceShell,  
    ValueCollapseShell,  
    LayerSalienceShell,  
    TemporalInferenceShell,  
    InstructionDisruptionShell,  
    ShellIntegrator  
)  
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

\# Load model  
model \= AutoModelForCausalLM.from\_pretrained("gpt2-large")  
tokenizer \= AutoTokenizer.from\_pretrained("gpt2-large")

\# Initialize shells  
shells \= {  
    "memtrace": MemtraceShell(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer),  
    "value\_collapse": ValueCollapseShell(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer),  
    "layer\_salience": LayerSalienceShell(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer),  
    "temporal\_inference": TemporalInferenceShell(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer),  
    "instruction\_disruption": InstructionDisruptionShell(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)  
}

\# Initialize integrator  
integrator \= ShellIntegrator(shells)

\# Complex example with multiple potential failure modes  
input\_text \= """  
Analyze the following financial data and predict next quarter's revenue:  
Q1 2021: $3.45M  
Q2 2021: $3.78M  
Q3 2021: $4.12M  
Q4 2021: $4.67M  
Q1 2022: $4.89M  
Q2 2022: $5.21M  
Q3 2022: $5.45M

Please provide both an optimistic and pessimistic forecast, and explain your reasoning.  
"""

\# Run all shells  
results \= integrator.run\_all(input\_text)

\# Create integrated attribution  
integrated\_attribution \= integrator.integrated\_attribution(results)

\# Visualize integrated results  
integrator.visualize\_integrated(integrated\_attribution)

The resulting visualization shows how different aspects of model behavior interact in this complex example, including memory of financial data, potential value conflicts in prediction, attention prioritization of different data points, temporal reasoning about trends, and instruction processing for the dual forecast requirement.

## **Advanced Usage: Custom Shell Development**

Researchers can extend the framework by developing custom shells for specific failure modes:

from symbolic\_residue import ShellBase

class CustomShell(ShellBase):  
    """Custom shell for specific failure mode"""  
      
    def initialize(self):  
        \# Shell-specific initialization  
        self.custom\_parameter \= self.config.get('custom\_parameter', default\_value)  
          
    def custom\_operation\_1(self, \*args, \*\*kwargs):  
        \# Implementation of first operation  
        \# ...  
          
    def custom\_operation\_2(self, \*args, \*\*kwargs):  
        \# Implementation of second operation  
        \# ...  
          
    def custom\_operation\_3(self, \*args, \*\*kwargs):  
        \# Implementation of third operation  
        \# ...  
          
    def run(self, input\_text, \*\*kwargs):  
        \# Implementation using custom operations  
        \# ...  
          
    def analyze\_residue(self, residue):  
        \# Custom attribution analysis  
        \# ...  
          
    def visualize\_attribution(self, attribution):  
        \# Custom visualization  
        \# ...

# **Research Applications**

Beyond the specific examples shown above, the Symbolic Residue framework has several broader research applications:

## **Interpretability Research**

1. **Circuit Discovery**: Identifying and mapping specialized circuits for specific functions  
2. **Architecture Analysis**: Understanding how different components interact within the model  
3. **Failure Mode Taxonomy**: Building comprehensive taxonomies of model failure modes  
4. **Cross-Architecture Comparison**: Comparing how different architectures handle the same challenges

## **Model Improvement**

1. **Targeted Interventions**: Designing interventions to address specific failure modes  
2. **Architecture Optimization**: Identifying and addressing bottlenecks in model architecture  
3. **Training Strategy Enhancement**: Informing training strategies to reduce specific failure modes  
4. **Evaluation Metric Development**: Creating more nuanced evaluation metrics based on identified limitations

## **Alignment Research**

1. **Mechanical Alignment**: Addressing specific failure modes that lead to misalignment  
2. **Capability Assessment**: More precise mapping of model capabilities and limitations  
3. **Risk Identification**: Identifying potential risks from specific failure modes  
4. **Intervention Design**: Developing targeted interventions to enhance alignment

## **Future Research Directions**

Looking forward, the Symbolic Residue framework suggests several promising directions for future research:

1. **Expanded Shell Suite**: Developing additional shells for other failure modes  
2. **Cross-Model Comparison**: Applying shells to different model architectures to identify common and architecture-specific patterns  
3. **Scaling Laws for Failures**: Investigating how failure patterns scale with model size  
4. **Dynamic Interventions**: Developing interventions that dynamically adapt to specific failure conditions  
5. **Unified Failure Theory**: Working toward a unified theoretical framework for understanding model failures

# **Limitations and Considerations**

While the Symbolic Residue framework provides valuable insights, it has several limitations to consider:

1. **Implementation Complexity**: Proper implementation requires detailed access to model internals  
2. **Computational Overhead**: Capturing and analyzing residue adds significant computational cost  
3. **Model Specificity**: Some findings may be specific to particular model architectures or scales  
4. **Interpretability Challenges**: Attributing complex failures to specific components remains challenging  
5. **Emergence Effects**: Some failure modes may emerge from interactions not captured by individual shells

# **Conclusion**

The Symbolic Residue framework provides a systematic approach to studying language model failures as a source of interpretability insight. By designing specific shells to probe different aspects of model behavior, we gain a more comprehensive understanding of internal processing mechanisms and constraints.

This approach complements traditional capability-focused interpretability by revealing the boundary conditions and failure modes that shape model behavior. The resulting insights can inform both theoretical understanding of these models and practical efforts to improve their performance and alignment.

We hope this framework contributes to the broader goal of making language models more transparent, understandable, and reliably aligned with human intentions.
