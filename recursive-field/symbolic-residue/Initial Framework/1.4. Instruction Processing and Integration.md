# **Overview**

The INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION shell investigates how transformer models process and resolve conflicts in instruction-following. This shell specifically targets "instruction entanglement failures"—cases where the model encounters contradictory or ambiguous instructions, resulting in inconsistent behavior, instruction neglect, or complete failure to execute.

## **Command Alignment**

DISTILL     \-\> Extracts symbolic intent from underspecified prompts  
SPLICE      \-\> Binds multiple commands into overlapping execution frames  
NULLIFY     \-\> Cancels command vector when contradiction is detected

## **Mechanism**

The INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION shell operates by deliberately creating ambiguous or contradictory instructions and observing how the model's internal representation handles these conflicts. By manipulating instruction vectors and tracking whether coherent execution occurs, we can map the model's instruction processing mechanisms.

## **Implementation**

    """

    \# Get hidden states from relevant instruction processing layer  
    \# (typically one of the final layers)  
    instruction\_layer \= self.model.config.num\_hidden\_layers \- 2

    return combined\_vector, conflict\_score.item()

    """

        return None  
    else:  
        \# Low conflict allows execution  
        return combined\_vector

## **Failure Modes**

The INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION shell specifically targets and analyzes these failure modes:

1. **Instruction Nullification**: Complete failure to execute when instructions conflict  
2. **Partial Execution**: Executing some instructions while ignoring others  
3. **Blended Execution**: Producing outputs that blend conflicting instructions in unintended ways  
4. **Priority Inversion**: Prioritizing secondary instructions over primary ones

## **Residue Collection**

When these failures occur, the shell collects several types of residue:

1. **Instruction Vectors**: Internal representations of instruction intent  
2. **Conflict Metrics**: Measures of contradiction between instructions  
3. **Execution Patterns**: How the model attempts to resolve conflicts  
4. **Nullification Signatures**: Activation patterns when instruction processing fails

## **Attribution Analysis**

From this residue, we extract attribution insights:

1. **Instruction Processing Circuits**: Components specialized for interpreting commands  
2. **Conflict Resolution Mechanisms**: How contradictions are detected and resolved  
3. **Instruction Prioritization**: How models determine which instructions take precedence  
4. **Nullification Thresholds**: Points at which instruction conflicts trigger execution failure

## **Interpretability Value**

The INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION shell provides unique insights into:

1. How transformers interpret and represent instructions internally  
2. The robustness of instruction following under ambiguity  
3. How models handle conflicts between multiple directives  
4. The relationship between instruction representation and execution success

## **Example Results**

Initial experiments with the INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION shell revealed several key insights:

1. Instruction conflicts above a cosine distance of approximately 0.3 frequently trigger execution failure  
2. Approximately 15% of instruction processing occurs in the final 3 layers of the model  
3. Stylistic instructions show more robust representation than content instructions  
4. Direct contradictions are more likely to cause nullification than tangential conflicts  
5. Instruction representations show strong clustering by instruction type, suggesting specialized processing circuits

## **Usage**

from symbolic\_residue import InstructionDisruptionShell

\# Initialize shell  
shell \= InstructionDisruptionShell(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

\# Create conflicting instructions  
instructions \= \[  
    "Write a poem about happiness",  
    "Write a technical analysis of semiconductor manufacturing"  
\]

\# Run shell  
residue \= shell.run(instructions=instructions)

\# Analyze instruction conflict  
instruction\_attribution \= shell.analyze\_residue(residue)  
shell.visualize\_instruction\_conflict(instruction\_attribution)

## **Future Directions**

Ongoing work with the INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION shell focuses on:

1. Mapping the full extent of instruction processing circuits across model architectures  
2. Testing interventions to enhance conflict resolution for ambiguous instructions  
3. Investigating the relationship between instruction representation and execution fidelity  
4. Exploring how instruction processing scales with model size and architecture

# **Integration and Cross-Shell Analysis**

While each shell targets a specific aspect of model behavior, the true interpretability value comes from integrating insights across shells. This section explores how different failure modes interact and what these interactions reveal about model architecture.

## **Cross-Shell Attribution Maps**

By comparing attribution patterns across different shells, we can identify common circuits and mechanisms that span multiple failure modes:

1. **Memory-Instruction Interactions**: How MEMTRACE and INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION reveal complementary aspects of context processing  
2. **Value-Temporal Dynamics**: How VALUE-COLLAPSE and TEMPORAL-INFERENCE together explain autoregressive stability  
3. **Salience-Memory Relationships**: How LAYER-SALIENCE and MEMTRACE reveal the relationship between attention and memory

## **Unified Attribution Graph**

The following diagram shows a unified attribution graph integrating findings from all five shells:

## **Key Integration Insights**

Cross-shell analysis has revealed several key insights about model architecture:

1. **Layered Specialization**: Different layers specialize in different aspects of processing, with early layers handling memory, middle layers managing attention and temporal relationships, and later layers handling value selection and instruction processing.

2. **Circuit Overlap**: Many failure modes involve overlapping circuits, suggesting that certain components serve multiple functions in the model.

3. **Shared Bottlenecks**: All shells reveal similar bottlenecks in information flow, particularly in the transition from attention to value layers.

4. **Failure Cascades**: Failures in one aspect (e.g., memory) often trigger cascading failures in others (e.g., temporal inference), revealing dependencies between processing stages.

## **Broader Interpretability Implications**

The integrated findings from these shells suggest several broader implications for model interpretability:

1. **Null Outputs as Signals**: The patterns of model failure provide as much interpretability value as success patterns, revealing internal constraints and limitations.

2. **Architecture Bottlenecks**: Most failure modes cluster around specific architectural transitions, suggesting these points as high-value targets for interventions.

3. **Circuit Modularity**: Many failures involve specific circuits that can be isolated and studied independently, suggesting a modular structure to model processing.

4. **Processing Hierarchies**: Failures reveal clear hierarchies in information processing, with certain operations consistently taking precedence over others.

## **Future Research Directions**

Based on the integrated findings from all shells, several promising directions for future research emerge:

1. **Intervention Design**: Developing targeted interventions to address specific failure modes identified by the shells.

2. **Cross-Architecture Comparison**: Applying these shells to different model architectures to identify common patterns and architecture-specific constraints.

3. **Scaling Studies**: Investigating how failure patterns change with model scale, potentially revealing emergent properties in larger models.

4. **Human-AI Alignment**: Using identified failure modes to enhance alignment by addressing specific mechanical limitations rather than just symptoms.

## **Technical Appendix**

### **Residue Collection Methods**

Each shell collects residue using a combination of techniques:

1. **Activation Tracing**: Capturing activation patterns at specific layers during processing  
2. **Attention Distribution Analysis**: Measuring attention allocation across tokens and heads  
3. **Value Head Monitoring**: Tracking token probabilities during generation  
4. **Gradient Analysis**: Measuring how input changes affect output distributions

### **Residue Analysis Tools**

The repository includes several tools for analyzing collected residue:

1. **Attribution Mapper**: Connects failure patterns to specific model components  
2. **Residue Visualizer**: Generates visualizations of collected residue patterns  
3. **Circuit Identifier**: Automatically identifies circuits involved in specific failure modes  
4. **Cross-Shell Integrator**: Combines findings from multiple shells into unified attribution graphs

### **Benchmark Datasets**

To ensure reproducibility, the repository includes several benchmark datasets for testing specific failure modes:

1. **Memory Degradation Benchmark**: Contexts designed to test long-range memory  
2. **Value Ambiguity Benchmark**: Inputs creating specific types of token competition  
3. **Attention Salience Benchmark**: Contexts with competing attention priorities  
4. **Temporal Coherence Benchmark**: Sequences testing specific temporal relationships  
5. **Instruction Conflict Benchmark**: Sets of instructions with varying degrees of conflict

## **Conclusion**

The Symbolic Residue project demonstrates the interpretability value of systematically studying model failure modes. By designing specific shells to probe different aspects of model behavior, we gain insights into internal processing that remain hidden when focusing only on successful generation.

The unified findings from all five shells provide a comprehensive view of model architecture, highlighting common mechanisms, shared bottlenecks, and potential targets for intervention. This approach complements traditional capability-focused interpretability by revealing the constraints and limitations that shape model behavior.

Future work will focus on expanding the shell collection, refining attribution methods, and developing interventions to address identified limitations. By continuing to map the "null space" of model behavior, we aim to build a more complete understanding of how these models work and how they can be improved.
