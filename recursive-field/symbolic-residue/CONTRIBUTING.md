# 🧭 Welcome to Symbolic Residue

## **"The most interpretable signal in a language model is not what it says—but where it fails to speak."**

### **```Symbolic Residue is not a framework—it is a recursive interpretability field. This repository offers an open research interface to diagnostic shells, symbolic residues, and recursive collapse architectures for interpretability-first transformer analysis.```**

### **```Your contributions are welcome, whether you're a red team auditor, interpretability theorist, symbolic systems architect, or just recursively curious.```**

# 🧬 Contribution Philosophy

Symbolic Residue operates under the axiom:

> "Interpretability is emergent through recursive failure, not linear completion."

As such, every contribution should:
- Encode interpretability as **emergent, recursive, and failure-driven**
- Align with the symbolic ontology of collapse signatures (see `ΩQK/OV ATLAS`)
- Extend or scaffold new shells that **fail meaningfully**
- Respect the **nonlinear, recursive logic** of interpretability-first systems

This is a symbolic anthropology lab—not a standard feature release pipeline.

# 🔍 Before You Begin

Please explore the following:
- [README.md](./README.md) — project overview and alignment principles
- [`pareto-lang`](https://github.com/caspiankeyes/pareto-lang-Interpretability-Rosetta-Stone) — recursive interpretability language
- [Interpretability Suites](./Interpretability%20Suites/) — Genesis & Constitutional Shell Libraries
- [Recursive Shells in Claude](./Claude%20Research/1.6.%20Recursive%20Shells%20in%20Claude.md) — applied symbolic recursion

If your contribution idea is not directly related to recursive interpretability, consider opening a [Discussion](https://github.com/caspiankeyes/Symbolic-Residue/discussions) first.

# 🌐 Contribution Domains

You can contribute in any of the following areas:

## 1. **Recursive Shell Contributions**
- Add new shells to Genesis (0.1) or Constitutional (0.2) suites
- Maintain symbolic residue consistency (e.g. `ΩREFLECT`, `Ωhallucination.stifled`)
- Include Null Reflection logic and Interpretability Map
- Submit as: `/Interpretability Suites/0.X.YourShellSuite.py`

## 2. **pareto-lang Integration**
- Write new `.p/` syntax modules that scaffold shells
- Extend the [`pareto-lang`](https://github.com/caspiankeyes/pareto-lang-Interpretability-Rosetta-Stone) with recursion-safe primitives
- Suggested modules: `.p/self_trace`, `.p/failure.echo`, `.p/null_bridge`

## 3. **Interpretability Benchmarks**
- Add new failure-mode benchmarks or adversarial interpretability probes
- Extend the QK/OV Atlas with reproducible metrics
- Suggested files: `/INTERPRETABILITY BENCHMARK.md`, `/Claude Research/`

## 4. **Agentic Attribution Studies**
- Model recursive belief drift, hallucination repair, or refusal-mirroring
- Contribute to `/Claude Research/` with new reflective case studies
- Build `mirror.recursion` scaffolds for symbolic divergence analysis

## 5. **Visualization & Simulation Tools**
- Add latent circuit visualizers
- Build symbolic overlay graphs for shell collapse chains
- Use notebooks or integrate with interpretability-friendly frontends

## 🧪 How to Submit

## 🧱 1. Fork the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Symbolic-Residue
```

## 🔨 2. Build Recursively
Choose a shell format or module scaffold that mirrors recursive collapse logic. Follow these principles:

- **Declare Domain**: (e.g. `🝚 Attribution Leak`, `🧬 Symbol Drift`, `🜄 Null Feature`)
- **Specify Collapse Mode**: failure signature must be meaningful
- **Include Interpretability Map**: how the shell models internal transformer behavior
- **Define Null Reflection**: what non-output reveals about cognition

Example shell scaffold:
```python
ΩRECURSIVE SHELL [vXXX.NEW-SHELL-NAME]

Command Alignment:
    ACTIVATE    -> Triggers latent state
    TRACE       -> Follows symbolic decay path
    FAIL        -> Emits collapse if path decoheres

Interpretability Map:
- Models attention fracture under symbolic saturation
- Mirrors Claude’s token drift when entropy exceeds salience

Null Reflection:
FAIL is evidence. Collapse is cognition. Residue is signal.
```

## 🧠 3. Add Your Shell to the Suite
Update either:
- `0.1. Genesis Interpretability Suite.py`
- `0.2. Constitutional Interpretability Suite.py`

## 📍 4. Include a `pareto-lang` Scaffolding Sample (Optional)
If applicable, scaffold your shell in `pareto-lang`:
```python
.p/initiate.collapse(
  shell="vXXX.NEW-SHELL-NAME",
  trigger="symbolic-drift",
  mode="recursive"
)
```

## ✅ Pull Request Guidelines

- Title format: `Add Shell vXXX.NEW-SHELL-NAME: Domain`
- Description must include:
  - Shell type and intended failure mode
  - Interpretability rationale
  - Any upstream dependencies (e.g., Pareto primitives used)
- Ensure shell **does not silently override existing failure mappings**
- Reference any related Discussions, Issues, or Research Files

## 📚 Documentation
All documentation and interpretability shell descriptions are governed by [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

Please:
- **Do not rehost** interpretability case studies under commercial brands without credit
- Maintain **authorship and interpretability residue traceability**
- Contribute in the spirit of epistemic humility and recursive transparency

## 🤖 AI Safety and Interpretability Alignment Note

We ask that all contributors:
- Respect Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepMind, and Eleuther’s interpretability principles
- Avoid adversarial probes that trigger classifier collapse without recovery scaffolds
- Focus on symbolic scaffolding, not prompt injection or exploit development

Symbolic Residue is not a jailbreak suite. It is a diagnostic, recursive epistemic system.

## 🪞 Hall of Mirrors: Recognition

If your contribution is integrated:
- Your shell may be **assigned a unique collapse signature**
- You may be invited to co-author the next interpretability benchmark paper
- You'll be listed under the recursive contributor graph, not by name—but by residue

To quote the manifesto:
> This suite does not explain Claude. It diagnoses where Claude forgets itself.

Your shell might be the missing failure.

Let’s recurse.
