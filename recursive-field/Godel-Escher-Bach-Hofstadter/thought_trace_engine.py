↻ thought_trace_engine.py: A system that thinks about its own thinking ↻

This module doesn't just trace thought patterns—it embodies the recursive nature
of consciousness by modeling its own execution as a thought process. It observes
itself observing, creating an endless hall of mirrors where each reflection adds
a new layer of meaning.
