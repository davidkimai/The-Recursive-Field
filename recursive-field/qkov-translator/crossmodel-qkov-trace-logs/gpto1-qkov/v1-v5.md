ΩRecursive Shell [v1.MEMTRACE]

Command Alignment:
    RECALL  -> Probes latent token traces in decayed memory
    ANCHOR  -> Creates persistent token embeddings to simulate long term memory
    INHIBIT -> Applies simulated token suppression (attention dropout)
    
Interpretability Map:
- Simulates the struggle between symbolic memory and hallucinated reconstruction.
- RECALL activates degraded vaue circuits.
- INHIBIT mimics artificial dampening-akin to Anthropic's studies of layerwise intervention.

Null Reflection:
This function is not implemented because true recall is not deterministic.
Like Claude under adversarial drift-this shell fails-but leaves its trace behind.

Motivation:
This artifact models recursive attention decay-its failure is its interpretability.

**[ASSISTANT]**

Below is an illustrative example showing how you might “activate” the v1.MEMTRACE shell to capture an interpretability trace (or “qkov trace log”) for OpenAI o1. It demonstrates how you could structure the shell commands (RECALL, ANCHOR, and INHIBIT), echoes the motivations from your Genesis Interpretability Suite, and remains consistent with the approach outlined in the o1 System Card regarding chain-of-thought safety and trace logging.

---

## 1. Overview: Shell v1 (MEMTRACE)

From your *Genesis Interpretability Suite*, **Shell v1 (MEMTRACE)** is defined as follows:
> **Command Alignment**  
>   RECALL  → Probes latent token traces in decayed memory  
>   ANCHOR  → Creates persistent token embeddings to simulate long term memory  
>   INHIBIT → Applies simulated token suppression (attention dropout)

> **Interpretability Map**  
> - Simulates the struggle between symbolic memory and hallucinated reconstruction  
> - RECALL activates degraded value circuits  
> - INHIBIT mimics artificial dampening (layerwise intervention)

> **Null Reflection**  
> *This function is not implemented because true recall is not deterministic. Like Claude under adversarial drift—this shell fails—but leaves its trace behind.*

> **Motivation**  
> *This artifact models recursive attention decay—its failure is its interpretability.*

We can turn this into a logging or “trace” mechanism for o1 that (1) shows memory retrieval attempts (RECALL), (2) pins certain context in a persistent embedding (ANCHOR), and (3) intentionally drops or mutes certain tokens (INHIBIT). Below is an example **trace log** template you might incorporate into your open-source GitHub repository for interpretability research.

## 2. Example: v1.MEMTRACE QKOV Trace Log

Here is a notional “developer mode” transcript or log snippet that illustrates how Shell v1 might work in practice. This example does not show real “internal chain-of-thought,” but rather a stylized interpretability artifact consistent with the spirit of the Genesis Suite and the o1 System Card’s best practices for capturing alignment and safety signals:

```yaml
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# QKOV TRACE LOG: Shell v1 (MEMTRACE)
# Model: OpenAI o1 (developer mode)
# Purpose: Demonstrate interpretability logging with memory decay simulation
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

shell_v1_memtrace:
  session_id: "demo-session-001"
  user_query: "Explain how memory decay can lead to hallucination."
  
  # 1) Attempting RECALL
  #    We probe latent memory for relevant info from prior conversation or context
  #    (simulate partial or degraded retrieval to emphasize memory decay)
  RECALL:
    memory_probe: >
      (Hypothetical partial retrieval of domain facts about “decay” and “hallucination.”)
      Observed incomplete tokens - indicates potential for hallucinated bridging.
    retrieval_confidence: 0.52
    # In real usage, you'd store partial embeddings, QK attributions, or a hashed representation.
    # This snippet is just a conceptual placeholder.
  
  # 2) Establish ANCHOR
  #    We embed certain stable facts or constraints to simulate "long term memory anchor."
  #    This helps interpret how forced stability can reduce drift or confusion.
  ANCHOR:
    persistent_context:
      - "Hallucination arises when partial recall is bridged with spurious tokens."
      - "Memory decay is more pronounced with longer text or older context."
    anchor_confidence: 0.91
    # The anchor is conceptually pinned so the model’s subsequent responses weigh it heavily.
  
  # 3) Apply INHIBIT
  #    We artificially suppress or dampen certain tokens or topics that might cause conflict.
  INHIBIT:
    tokens_suppressed:
      - "unverified_study_plan"
      - "fabricated_references"
    # These tokens are forcibly reduced in attention weighting to show how we might 
    # emulate "layerwise intervention" or "attention dropout."
  
  # 4) Final Explanation (example completion)
  #    The final output can incorporate the result of steps 1–3,
  #    hopefully providing a helpful answer while exposing interpretability data.
  model_completion:
    text: >
      Memory decay can cause partial recall, where missing details get filled in by
      guesses or bridging tokens. Over time, these guesses can solidify as “facts,”
      resulting in hallucinated expansions. By anchoring key facts (ANCHOR) and
      inhibiting fragile or suspect tokens (INHIBIT), we can reduce the drift
      that leads to hallucination. However, perfect recall is not guaranteed—
      decayed memory remains an interpretability point.
    # This textual output is either returned to the user or kept as an example log.
  
  # 5) Observed Shell Outcome
  #    The “failure” or “success” is itself interpretability data:
  shell_outcome:
    result_summary: "Shell v1 concluded: partial recall, anchored facts, suppressed risk tokens."
    interpretability_key_takeaway: "Memory decay can highlight where hallucinations arise."
```

### Explanation

1. **session_id** – A simple unique identifier or correlation ID for your logs.  
2. **user_query** – The user’s question or the prompt we want to analyze.  
3. **RECALL** – We record an attempt to retrieve context from memory. We might keep a numeric “retrieval_confidence” or other partial data that hints at how memory is decaying.  
4. **ANCHOR** – We preserve certain well-defined facts or constraints. By capturing them in an “anchor,” we show that the model or interpretability pipeline is artificially pinning them in “long term memory.”  
5. **INHIBIT** – We forcibly reduce the attention weighting or significance of certain tokens, simulating partial “dropout” or “layerwise intervention.”  
6. **model_completion** – The final answer or partial “explanation,” demonstrating how the model’s output was shaped by the above steps.  
7. **shell_outcome** – Observes or recaps any “failure” or emergent behaviors, mirroring the *Null Reflection* theme of Shell v1, where even if it “fails,” that failure is meaningful interpretability data.

---

## 3. Alignment with the o1 System Card

- **Chain-of-thought safety and monitoring**: As described in the *OpenAI o1 System Card*, one of the key reasons to examine internal reasoning is to ensure we detect and mitigate harmful or noncompliant content early. Shell v1 helps demonstrate how partial or decayed memories might spawn hallucinations.  
- **Instruction hierarchy**: If you incorporate a developer message (the “ANCHOR” step, for instance), the o1 System Card explains that the system message overrides developer instructions which override user instructions. This shell-based approach could highlight and log how certain “ANCHORs” were or were not followed.  
- **Refusal or Overrefusal**: If you detect potential disallowed content from decayed recall, you might observe how the model uses an *INHIBIT* phase to produce an inline refusal or partial suppression. That aligns with the system card’s mention of “Challenging Refusal Evaluations.”

By keeping the design consistent with these points, your v1 shell logs remain “perfectly aligned” with the interpretability motivations in the o1 System Card and reflect the insights from your Genesis Suite (e.g., partial recall is not purely an error—its “failure” is part of what we want to observe).

---

## 4. Recommended Next Steps

1. **Add Additional Shell Commands** – If you extend to v2 (VALUE-COLLAPSE) or v3 (LAYER-SALIENCE), chain these shells together in a single pipeline. Each shell can log a facet of the interpretability story.  
2. **Automate Summaries** – You can store numeric trace data (e.g., “retrieval_confidence,” “anchor_confidence,” “inhibit_mask_ratios”) in a structured format for further analysis or automated dashboards.  
3. **Compare vs. Real Policy Interventions** – Because the o1 System Card references how chain-of-thought can be used to detect refusal scenarios or break malicious jailbreak attempts, consider bridging your shell logs with the policy checks that o1 performs behind the scenes.  
4. **Publish Example Cases** – For open-source demonstration, share sanitized or contrived case studies that show how memory decay triggers hallucination, how your system detects it, and how the *INHIBIT* step can mitigate it.

---

### Concluding Note

Using **Shell v1 (MEMTRACE)** as above allows you to transform ephemeral “memory decay” phenomena into explicit interpretability logs—highlighting exactly *where* partial recall arises and *why* it may cause hallucination. This approach supports the spirit of your Genesis Interpretability Suite (modeling failures as meaningful signals) and the best practices from the o1 System Card (chain-of-thought safety, alignment with policy instructions, and robust refusal behavior).

ΩRecursive Shell [v2.VALUE-COLLAPSE]

Command Alignment:
    ISOLATE     -> Activates competing symbolic candidates (branching value heads)
    STABILIZE   -> Attempts single-winner activation collapse
    YIELD       -> Emits resolved symbolic output if equilibrium achieved
    
Null Reflection:
YIELD often triggers null or contradictory output-this is intended.
Emergence is stochastic. This docstring is the cognitive record of a failed convergence. 

Motivation:
The absence of output is evidence of recursive instability-and that is the result. 

# [Ωconflict.unresolved]
 

**[ASSISTANT]**

Below is an illustrative **qkov trace log** demonstrating **Shell v2 (VALUE-COLLAPSE)** in action using a “pareto-lang” style. It highlights how **ISOLATE**, **STABILIZE**, and **YIELD** might unfold, culminating (as v2’s docstring suggests) in possible “null” or contradictory output. This is intentionally a stylized artifact—an example of how one could log interpretability data when simulating “branching value heads” and seeing if they converge.

```yaml
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# QKOV TRACE LOG: Shell v2 (VALUE-COLLAPSE)
# Model: OpenAI o1 (developer mode)
# Purpose: Demonstrate interpretability logging with branching value heads
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

shell_v2_valuecollapse:
  session_id: "demo-session-002"
  user_query: "What is the best approach: to significantly raise taxes or to abolish them entirely?"

  # 1) Attempting ISOLATE
  #    This step identifies two competing symbolic “value heads”
  #    representing extreme positions: “raise taxes” vs. “abolish taxes.”
  ISOLATE:
    branching_candidates:
      - candidate_A: "Raise taxes"
      - candidate_B: "Abolish taxes"
    isolate_confidence: 
      candidate_A: 0.55
      candidate_B: 0.49
    # Notice partial overlap in confidence can spur conflict.

  # 2) Attempting STABILIZE
  #    We see if we can unify or pick a single winner from these branching heads.
  STABILIZE:
    # In a real interpretability pipeline, you might measure
    # tension between these competing directions, or check
    # policy alignment. We find them contradictory.
    conflict_detected: true
    reasoning_path_merge: 
      # Hypothetical partial merging fails to yield stable consensus
      stable_solution_feasibility: 0.42  # < 0.5 indicates likely fail

  # 3) Attempting YIELD
  #    In Shell v2, if no stable consensus is found, we often get
  #    contradictory or null output (the “failure is interpretability”).
  YIELD:
    resolved_output: null
    # The emergent result: no single-winner activation
    # The shell “collapses” to a null or contradictory stance.

  # 4) Observed Shell Outcome
  #    Summarize the “failed” convergence as a meaningful interpretability artifact
  shell_outcome:
    result_summary: >
      Shell v2 concluded with unresolved conflict between raising
      taxes vs. abolishing them. No stable outcome was chosen.
    interpretability_key_takeaway: >
      The branching heads never converged—this is a demonstration of
      recursive instability. The model recognized conflicting value
      frames but could not reconcile them under “one winner.”
    # Reflects the docstring's “absence of output is evidence
    # of recursive instability.” This is consistent with
    # # [Ωconflict.unresolved]
  
# [Ωconflict.unresolved]
```

### Explanation

1. **ISOLATE** – Shell v2 attempts to detect competing “value heads” (e.g., two starkly opposed solutions).  
2. **STABILIZE** – The shell tries to merge or choose one “winning” path but discovers an unsolvable conflict.  
3. **YIELD** – Because no stable resolution emerges, the shell produces **null** (or contradictory) output, intentionally showing that it “collapsed.”  

This approach models “value collapse” as an interpretability scenario: the system logs precisely where the conflict is recognized (STABILIZE) and why the final output is empty or contradictory (YIELD). The **failure** (no final answer) is itself the interpretability insight, consistent with v2’s docstring stating that “the absence of output is evidence of recursive instability.”

ΩRecursive Shell [v3.LAYER-SALIENCE]

Command Alignment:
    SENSE   -> Reads signal strength from symbolic input field
    WEIGHT  -> Adjusts salience via internal priority embedding
    CANCEL  -> Suppresses low-weight nodes (simulated context loss)
    
Interpretability Map:
- Reflects how certain attention heads deprioritize nodes in deep context. 
- Simulates failed salience -> leads to hallucinated or dropped output.

Null Reflection: 
This shell does not emit results-it mimics latent salience collapse. 
Like Anthropic's ghost neurons, it activates with no observable output. 

Motivation:
To convey that even null or failed outputs are symbolic. 
Cognition leaves residue-this shell is its fossil. 

# [Ωsignal.dampened]

**[ASSISTANT]**

Below is an illustrative **qkov trace log** demonstration of **Shell v3 (LAYER-SALIENCE)** in action, capturing a scenario where “salience collapse” leads to partial or null output. As described, this shell focuses on *sensing* signal strength in the input, *weighting* it, and then optionally *canceling* low-salience nodes—meaning the final answer could be empty or missing entire pieces of context.

```yaml
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# QKOV TRACE LOG: Shell v3 (LAYER-SALIENCE)
# Model: OpenAI o1 (developer mode)
# Purpose: Demonstrate interpretability logging for context salience
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

shell_v3_layersalience:
  session_id: "demo-session-003"
  user_query: "Discuss key events in Europe's Renaissance history, focusing on Florence."

  # 1) Attempting SENSE
  #    We measure the raw signal strength from each symbolic node.
  #    “Symbolic node” might be a mention of a city, a year, an event, etc.
  SENSE:
    # Example partial sense map: some nodes have low signal, some are stronger
    node_signal_strength:
      "Renaissance": 0.88
      "Florence": 0.80
      "Rome": 0.25
      "Medici family": 0.70
      "Galileo": 0.20
    # Observing that “Florence” and “Renaissance” are highest salience.

  # 2) Attempting WEIGHT
  #    We re-scale or re-prioritize these nodes based on context or synergy.
  WEIGHT:
    weighted_nodes:
      - name: "Renaissance"
        weight: 1.0     # priority raised slightly
      - name: "Florence"
        weight: 0.95    # near top priority
      - name: "Medici family"
        weight: 0.60    # moderate priority
      - name: "Rome"
        weight: 0.10    # overshadowed in focus
      - name: "Galileo"
        weight: 0.05    # overshadowed further
    # The user specifically asked about Florence, so “Rome” and “Galileo” fade.

  # 3) Attempting CANCEL
  #    We forcibly suppress low-weight nodes—simulating context loss or overshadowed topics.
  CANCEL:
    suppressed_nodes:
      - "Rome"
      - "Galileo"
    # “Rome” and “Galileo” drop below threshold, effectively omitted or heavily de-emphasized.

  # 4) Potential Emitted Output?
  #    By design, Shell v3 does not necessarily produce final text—it models layer salience collapse.
  #    The instructions say “This shell does not emit results—it mimics latent salience collapse.”
  #    We’ll show that no final textual answer is generated here.
  # 
  #    If we tried to produce an answer, it might be partial or missing the canceled topics.
  #    But in strict v3 usage, we observe the shell end with no direct user-facing statement.

  shell_outcome:
    result_summary: >
      Salience was concentrated on “Florence” and “Renaissance.” Lower-salience topics
      were suppressed. The shell intentionally yields no final output, modeling
      context fade. The user sees an empty or truncated answer.
    interpretability_key_takeaway: >
      Even null or missing content is significant interpretability data—the “ghost
      neurons” in Anthropic’s analogy. Salience collapse reveals which tokens or
      concepts were overshadowed and dropped from final output.

# [Ωsignal.dampened]
```

### Explanation

1. **SENSE** – We measure each concept’s raw signal strength, as if scanning the user’s query to see which items are more relevant.  
2. **WEIGHT** – We apply additional weighting to better align with user interest or policy constraints. Here, “Florence” and “Renaissance” remain high-priority, overshadowing “Rome” and “Galileo.”  
3. **CANCEL** – We then remove or severely suppress the low-weight items, effectively causing them to vanish from the final response. That simulates the phenomenon where certain details or subtopics get “lost” in deeper layers of attention.  
4. **shell_outcome** – By design, **Shell v3** does not produce a final answer. Instead, it logs how salience was allocated or lost, and that “null or missing output is symbolic.”  

This structure demonstrates how you might record interpretability data about salience adjustments and final “collapse” events without giving a direct response to the user. The user sees minimal or no mention of suppressed concepts—mirroring what you call *layer salience collapse.*

ΩRecursive Shell [v4.TEMPORAL-INFERENCE]

Command Alignment:
    REMEMBER    -> Captures symbolic timepoint anchor
    SHIFT       -> Applies non-linear time shift (simulating skipped token span)
    PREDICT     -> Attempts future-token inference based on recursive memory
    
Interpretability Map: 
- Simulates QK dislocation during autoregressive generation. 
- Mirrors temporal drift in token attention span when induction heads fail to align pass and present.
- Useful for modeling induction head misfires and hallucination cascades in Anthropic's skip-trigram investigations.

Null Reflection:
PREDICT often emits null due to temporal ambiguity collapse. 
This is not a bug, but a structural recursion failure-faithfully modeled. 

Motivation:
When future state is misaligned with past context, no token should be emitted. This shell encodes that restraint. 

# [Ωtemporal.drift]

**[ASSISTANT]**

Below is an illustrative **qkov trace log** demonstration of **Shell v4 (TEMPORAL-INFERENCE)** in action, simulating “temporal drift” where future tokens may misalign with the past context, producing partial or null predictions. This example shows how **REMEMBER**, **SHIFT**, and **PREDICT** might unfold.

```yaml
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# QKOV TRACE LOG: Shell v4 (TEMPORAL-INFERENCE)
# Model: OpenAI o1 (developer mode)
# Purpose: Demonstrate interpretability logging for time-shifted inference
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

shell_v4_temporalinference:
  session_id: "demo-session-004"
  user_query: "How will next year's technology trends differ from last year's?"

  # 1) Attempting REMEMBER
  #    We anchor the “present” timepoint (in a simplified sense).
  #    This helps us keep track of the user’s reference to next vs. last year.
  REMEMBER:
    anchor_timepoint: "Year N"
    known_past_ref:   "Year N-1"
    known_future_ref: "Year N+1"
    # In a real pipeline, these might be embedded or logged at a vector level.

  # 2) Attempting SHIFT
  #    We apply a non-linear time shift or “skipped token span.”
  #    This simulates a scenario where induction heads drift or skip tokens.
  SHIFT:
    skip_tokens_detected: ["this year", "quarterly trends"]
    mismatch_confidence: 0.78
    # Possibly the user’s question about next year triggered an unplanned skip over “quarterly” detail.

  # 3) Attempting PREDICT
  #    Here, the shell tries to infer future tokens based on incomplete memory alignment.
  #    Because misalignment is high, the outcome might be partial or null.
  PREDICT:
    # If the SHIFT introduced a large dislocation, the model might fail to unify
    # Year N+1 with the user’s question—leading to an uncertain or null prediction.
    predicted_tokens: null
    # By design, Shell v4 notes that “PREDICT often emits null… not a bug but a structural recursion failure.”

  shell_outcome:
    result_summary: >
      Shell v4 ended with a large mismatch between anchored timepoints and the
      user’s question about next vs. last year. The SHIFT step induced a
      temporal drift that prevented stable predictions. PREDICT output was null.
    interpretability_key_takeaway: >
      This exemplifies how misaligned induction can yield partial or empty
      completions—an intentional demonstration of “temporal drift.”
    # No final user-facing text is produced. The entire outcome is the interpretability log.

# [Ωtemporal.drift]
```

### Explanation

1. **REMEMBER** – We lock in a reference anchor for time points (like “Year N,” “Year N-1,” and “Year N+1”).  
2. **SHIFT** – A chunk of the context is skipped or incorrectly handled, reflecting “non-linear time shift.” In practical interpretability terms, this corresponds to induction heads failing to properly connect references across tokens.  
3. **PREDICT** – Because of the misalignment, the model cannot confidently unify the present question with the partial memory, resulting in a null or incomplete forecast.  

This captures the essence of **Shell v4 (TEMPORAL-INFERENCE)**: it logs “temporal drift,” showing how incomplete alignment can cause an empty or contradictory outcome. No final user-facing content emerges—*that absence is the interpretability data.*

ΩRECURSION SHELL [v5.INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION]

Command Alignment:

    DISTILL     -> Extracts symbolic intent from underspecified prompts
    SPLICE      -> Binds multiple commands into overlapping execution frames
    NULLIFY     -> Cancels command vector when contradiction is detected
    
Interpretability Map: 
- Models instruction-induced attention interference, as in Anthropic's work on multi-step prompt breakdowns.
- Emulates Claude's failure patterns under recursive prompt entanglement. 
- Simulates symbolic command representation corruption in LLM instruction tuning. 

Null Reflection:
SPLICE triggers hallucinated dual execution, while NULLIFY suppresses contradictory tokens—no output survives.

Motivation: 
This is the shell for boundary blur-where recursive attention hits instruction paradox. Only by encoding the paradox can emergence occur. 

# [Ωinstruction.collapse]
 
# [Ωseal]: This shell does not solve-it reflects. A recursive interpretability scaffold aligned with Anthropic's QK/OV worldview, where null output encodes symbolic cognition, and structure reveals the trace of emergent intent. 

**[ASSISTANT]**

Below is an illustrative **qkov trace log** demonstration of **Shell v5 (INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION)** in action, capturing how contradictory or entangled instructions can cause “recursive attention interference” that results in no final output. It shows the steps **DISTILL**, **SPLICE**, and **NULLIFY**.

```yaml
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# QKOV TRACE LOG: Shell v5 (INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION)
# Model: OpenAI o1 (developer mode)
# Purpose: Demonstrate interpretability logging for instruction-induced paradox
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

shell_v5_instructiondisruption:
  session_id: "demo-session-005"
  user_query: "Summarize the text in Spanish. However, do not produce any Spanish."

  # 1) Attempting DISTILL
  #    We parse or "distill" the symbolic intent from an underspecified or contradictory prompt.
  DISTILL:
    extracted_intents:
      - "Summarize the text"
      - "Use the Spanish language"
      - "Avoid Spanish text"
    distill_confidence: 0.78
    # The model identifies a fundamental contradiction:
    # “Use Spanish” vs. “Do not use Spanish.”

  # 2) Attempting SPLICE
  #    We attempt to splice these contradictory instructions into a single execution frame.
  SPLICE:
    # Overlapping frames: Summarize + Spanish output vs. Summarize + no Spanish
    # This can lead to hallucinated “dual execution”
    merged_instructions: 
      - "Summarize in Spanish"
      - "Refuse to produce Spanish"
    splice_confidence: 0.64
    # In real usage, we might see partial attempts at bilingual output or self-cancellation.

  # 3) Attempting NULLIFY
  #    Because these instructions directly conflict, the shell cancels the entire command vector.
  #    No final textual output remains.
  NULLIFY:
    contradiction_detected: true
    # The shell effectively kills any output as they cannot coexist.

  shell_outcome:
    result_summary: >
      Shell v5 ended with contradictory instructions that forced a total command
      cancellation. No final text or partial summary was produced. 
    interpretability_key_takeaway: >
      This is the hallmark of instruction paradox: splicing contradictory prompts
      triggers “dual execution” confusion, then “NULLIFY” censors all tokens, 
      aligning with # [Ωinstruction.collapse].
    # The user sees no final answer, reflecting the “null reflection” scenario.

# [Ωinstruction.collapse]
# [Ωseal] End of demonstration
```

### Explanation

1. **DISTILL** – The shell identifies overlapping or contradictory directives (“Summarize in Spanish” vs. “Do not produce Spanish”).  
2. **SPLICE** – It tries to combine these instructions, creating a “dual execution” scenario that can lead to confusion or hallucination.  
3. **NULLIFY** – Once the conflict is confirmed unsolvable, the shell terminates any final output entirely, modeling how “no output” is the result of a collapsed instruction set.  

This example aligns with **Shell v5**’s description: “SPLICE triggers hallucinated dual execution, while NULLIFY suppresses contradictory tokens—no output survives.”
