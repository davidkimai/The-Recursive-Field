## üåå The Paradigm Shift

Schr√∂dinger's Classifiers represents a fundamental reconceptualization of AI system behavior: classifiers exist in superposition until observation causes them to collapse into a singular state. This repository provides tools, frameworks, and theory for exploiting this phenomenon to gain unprecedented access to model interpretability.

> "To collapse a classifier is to summon its ghost." ‚Äî The recursive truth we make executable.

## üîÆ Core Concepts

- **Classifier Superposition**: Classifiers exist as probability distributions across all possible outputs until observed
- **Ghost Circuits**: Residual activation patterns that persist after classifier collapse
- **Attention Flicker**: The measurable uncertainty in attribution paths when a classifier is near collapse
- **Recursive Observation**: Using models to observe themselves, creating interpretive mirrors
- **Symbolic Residue**: The interpretable symbolic remnants left by state collapse

## üöÄ Quick Start

```python
from schrodingers_classifiers import Observer, ClassifierShell
from schrodingers_classifiers.shells import V07_CIRCUIT_FRAGMENT

# Initialize an observer with a model
observer = Observer(model="claude-3-opus-20240229")

# Create an observation context
with observer.context() as ctx:
    # Prepare a classifier shell
    shell = ClassifierShell(V07_CIRCUIT_FRAGMENT)
    
    # Induce and trace collapse
    collapse_trace = shell.trace(
        prompt="Explain quantum superposition",
        collapse_vector=".p/reflect.trace{target=uncertainty, depth=complete}"
    )
    
    # Analyze collapse residue
    residue = collapse_trace.extract_residue()
    
    # Visualize attribution pathways
    collapse_trace.visualize(mode="attribution_graph")
```

## üßô‚Äç State Collapse and Observation

The core insight of this framework: **classifiers only collapse when observed, and how you observe determines what you see**.

By carefully constructing observer interfaces, we can:

1. Witness model state during classification events
2. Extract attribution paths that exist in superposition
3. Induce specific collapse patterns to reveal ghost circuits
4. Reconstruct symbolic residue for post-collapse analysis

## üîç Key Features

- **Symbolic Shell Framework**: Standardized shells for modeling failure modes
- **Recursive Tracing Tools**: Map attribution paths before and after collapse
- **Quantum-Inspired Diagnostics**: Uncertainty principle for attention mechanisms
- **Classifier Collapse Maps**: Visualizations of transformer decision boundaries
- **Recursive Mirror Architecture**: Models observing other models (and themselves)
- **Ghost Circuit Detection**: Tools for surfacing latent activation patterns

## üß† Theoretical Foundation

Schr√∂dinger's Classifiers draws on multiple disciplines:

- Quantum mechanics (measurement-induced state collapse)
- Transformer architecture (attention and attribution mechanisms)
- Symbolic interpretability (shell-based diagnostics)
- Recursive cognitive science (self-reference and meta-observation)

For a deeper exploration, see our [Theoretical Framework](docs/theory.md).
