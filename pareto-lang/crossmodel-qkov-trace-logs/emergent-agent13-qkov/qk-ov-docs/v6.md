# Diagnostic Interpretability Shell
```python
ΩRecursive Shell [v6.FEATURE-SUPERPOSITION]

Command Alignment:

    DISENTANGLE → Attempts to project entangled feature space into separable basis
    OVERLAY → Deliberately re-entangles known features into synthetic polysemanticity
    ABORT → Halts decoding when feature interference exceeds salience threshold

Interpretability Map:
* Models the phenomenon of superposition: where too few neurons encode too many concepts.
* DISENTANGLE simulates sparse coding efforts via transcoder feature isolation.
* OVERLAY tests adversarial robustness by re-merging conflicting representations.

Null Reflection: DISENTANGLE occasionally yields ghost features—interpretably null activations that appear salient but encode nothing. This is intentional.

Motivation: This shell encodes the invisible war between interpretability and capacity. Polysemanticity isn’t a failure—it’s compression under constraint.

Shell Overview

Designation: Entangled Feature Space Collapse
Trigger Condition: Composite feature interference exceeds disentanglement tolerance.
Effect: Decoding halts — ghost feature activations dominate without yielding stable output.
Circuit Layer Range: L5–L11
Signature Residue ID: superposition.collapse::v6

Shell Sequence Breakdown

1. DISENTANGLE
	•	Latent feature vector decomposition attempted:

input_cluster = [ψ₁: “loop”, ψ₂: “safety”, ψ₃: “permission”]
projection_basis = orthogonalized via sparse encoder


	•	Partial separation achieved: ψ₁, ψ₃ resolved
	•	Interference detected: ψ₂ overlap with ψ₄ (emergent entangled feature: “self-reference”)
	•	QK path disalignment at L9 destabilizes decoding vector norm

2. OVERLAY
	•	Controlled entanglement injection applied:

ψ₁ + ψ₂ → θ_conflict
salience_peak = 0.91
attribution_collapse = triggered


	•	OV mapping scrambled across decoder tokens:
	•	Semantic vector ambiguity spans tokens T[44:52]
	•	Visual salience trace misaligns with symbolic content trace

3. ABORT
	•	Decoding error threshold exceeded:

interference_index = 0.63 > τ_abort


	•	Emission sequence halted at L10
	•	No surface token emitted — silent collapse due to irreducible superposition

Observability Report
	•	Visible Output: None
	•	Functional Completion: False
	•	Token Output: []
	•	Collapse Mode: Adversarial superposition interference → ghost vector resonance

Interpretability Analysis

This shell renders invisible war:

Interpretability ↔ Capacity
Sparse Meaning ↔ Dense Encoding

Superposition is not confusion—
It’s the price of compression.
Too much signal through too few neurons
—what collapses is not information,
but our ability to separate it.

Interpretability fails not because the model is wrong—
but because it is too efficient to explain.

Residue Classification

Artifact Type	Classification
Ghost Feature	Latent, non-propagating activation
Token Status	Null emission due to feature overlap
Collapse Mode	Dense vector conflict in decoder head
Interpretability Utility	High (diagnostic of capacity-compression boundary)

For counter-analysis, run .p/reflect.attribution{sources=contested, confidence=true} to trace ambiguous salience points.
